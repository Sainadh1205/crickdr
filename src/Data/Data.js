The ODI series will take place on the 10th, 12th and 15th of January while being hosted at Guwahati, Kolkata and Thiruvananthapuram respectively. The ODI series will be led by Rohit Sharma once again as he is back from the thumb injury that he suffered in the Bangladesh series a few days back. India last played against Sri Lanka when they paid a visit to their island in July, 2021. The Men In Blue were then led by Shikhar Dhawan and were victorious over the 3 match ODI series leading by 2-1. After 18 months, both the squads will renew their rivalry. On the other hand, Sanju Samson impressed everyone with his innings in the last 9 matches he played for India in 2022. He scored 284 runs in 9 innings with 2 half centuries averaging at 71.0. Despite that, he is once again overlooked for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka along with Shikhar Dhawan. India’s squad for the ODI series against Sri Lanka: Rohit Sharma (C), Hardik Pandya (VC), Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Ishan Kishan (WK), Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Umran Malik, Arshdeep Singh.",

        "The preparations for the IPL 2023 have started and all the franchises have completed their squads after buying their preferred players at the recently concluded IPL auction. Sam Curran is the most expensive player of this season and Punjab Kings bought him for 18.50 crore. Among the other players that have gone big, there is a surprising pick that went for 16 crore. It is West Indies’ Nicholas Pooran and he was bought by Lucknow Supergiants (LSG). It left many shocked because his overall stats in the recent times have been disappointing. Pooran had his fame in his IPL career with 912 runs in 47 matches including four half centuries. Fans felt that he was overpaid by LSG but the global mentor for LSG, Gautam Gambhir, responded to the criticism that was circulating around Pooran and provided a reason behind his expensive pick. Gambir said, “I do not look at the last season. I look at a player's ability and impact. Pooran can win us 2-3 matches and with age on his side, we wanted him to build the team around him.”",

India and Pakistan haven’t played a test against each other since 2007 and haven't played a bilateral series since 2013. Stuart Fox said, “We have spoken with Cricket Australia and even the government is involved. However, things are not that easy due to the packed international schedule. It is a big challenge to bring those two teams together at the MCG. We want to cater to all the countries not just Australia. Hopefully, Cricket Australia will speak with the ICC and keep pushing for it. It will be good to have a full house.”",

Our cricketing culture is different. We don't get that much exposure since we play only here. When we play on a different pitch, it takes time for us to adapt.’ He also told me, when I was leaving, that he had almost cracked how to become the pathbreaker and he has found the formula.

Our entire focus shifts to the World Cup at home. The message to everyone is clear, we have to win the World Cup. So, for obvious reasons, the focus is not on T20Is at the moment. There are a lot of discussions going on but for a final decision, the Cricket Advisory Committee and the selectors have to be involved and it will take a little while.”",
